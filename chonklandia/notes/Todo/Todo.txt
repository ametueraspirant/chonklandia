clean up the editor, make it more "gui"
add brushes, brush sizes, and stuff like a disruptor or smoother that either randomize nearby heights, or smooth them out.
add buildings, including a way to smooth out the terrain they're on top of and disallow building on terrain that's too steep.
add chonks and their pathfinding.


#TODO
make a texture group for all sprites in vbuff
texture_get_texel_width, texel_get_texture height, and sprite_get_uvs to map UV coords
or make single texture page and self texture atlas
math sick nasty easy
texel width = 1/texture width, texel height = 1/texture height
